										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I already reviewed this on my old blog, Dadiocoleman. Since I don&#8217;t have a backup of my posts from that site I am rereviewing it.</p>
<p><span id="more-1199"></span></p>
<p>Oh boy. So I think I&#8217;m speaking for everyone when I say the premise is the most niche part of this fanfic. Keep in mind, for the most part the story itself isn&#8217;t really niche, but going on the description alone, you would assume it is.</p>
<p>Exchange is&#8230; strange. Twilight Sparkle is in love with the protagonist and believes it&#8217;s mutual, but he doesn&#8217;t realize it yet. That combined with her using her powers to get closer to him makes this story a very wild ride. She is obsessed with him, and while I don&#8217;t doubt there&#8217;s many a human who&#8217;d love to be in his place, I personally feel uncomfortable when reading some these scenes. Autismo &#8211; as he&#8217;s taken to calling her &#8211; is insane. She will risk the safety of her kingdom just to get him to love her back.</p>
<p>So yeah. This is a very, <em>very</em> wild ride.</p>
<p>Up until now you&#8217;d assume the story isn&#8217;t that great. If you can get past the&#8230; weird premise, you may actually like this story. It&#8217;s fun, has some amazing world-building and lore. Everyone is in character (save for Twilight of course). And yes, our human does indeed fall in love with a pony (guess who, not Twilight). It&#8217;s very fun. And while yes, Twilight&#8217;s shenanigans are overall strange, they are pretty funny actually.</p>
<p>I think my favorite part has to be the adventure elements, though Celestia has some really great moments as well.</p>
<hr />
<p>To conclude, this is a phenomenal fanfic. It&#8217;s fun, has some warm moments, and&#8230; strange ones. If you can get past the premise, you may actually come to love this little gem.</p>
