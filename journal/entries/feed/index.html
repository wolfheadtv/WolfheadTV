										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I already reviewed this on my old blog, Dadiocoleman. Since I don&#8217;t have a backup of my posts from that site I am rereviewing it.</p>
<p><span id="more-1199"></span></p>
<p>Oh boy. So I think I&#8217;m speaking for everyone when I say the premise is the most niche part of this fanfic. Keep in mind, for the most part the story itself isn&#8217;t really niche, but going on the description alone, you would assume it is.</p>
<p>Exchange is&#8230; strange. Twilight Sparkle is in love with the protagonist and believes it&#8217;s mutual, but he doesn&#8217;t realize it yet. That combined with her using her powers to get closer to him makes this story a very wild ride. She is obsessed with him, and while I don&#8217;t doubt there&#8217;s many a human who&#8217;d love to be in his place, I personally feel uncomfortable when reading some these scenes. Autismo &#8211; as he&#8217;s taken to calling her &#8211; is insane. She will risk the safety of her kingdom just to get him to love her back.</p>
<p>So yeah. This is a very, <em>very</em> wild ride.</p>
<p>Up until now you&#8217;d assume the story isn&#8217;t that great. If you can get past the&#8230; weird premise, you may actually like this story. It&#8217;s fun, has some amazing world-building and lore. Everyone is in character (save for Twilight of course). And yes, our human does indeed fall in love with a pony (guess who, not Twilight). It&#8217;s very fun. And while yes, Twilight&#8217;s shenanigans are overall strange, they are pretty funny actually.</p>
<p>I think my favorite part has to be the adventure elements, though Celestia has some really great moments as well.</p>
<hr />
<p>To conclude, this is a phenomenal fanfic. It&#8217;s fun, has some warm moments, and&#8230; strange ones. If you can get past the premise, you may actually come to love this little gem.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Once I can afford it I will be purchasing a new laptop. It is between the new Dell XPS 13 and the MacBook Pro 13 that will be out in the summer.</p>
<p><span id="more-576"></span></p>
<p>Over the summer I will attend driving school. This is step one in preparing me for my ultimate goal: Living in a van.</p>
<p>After getting my driver’s license I will begin the search for a Volkswagen Vanagon Westfalia (preferably a 4&#215;4 Synchro model). It won’t be easy as I have to find the right one. Once I’ve found and purchased the van I will spend the following months making it livable; documenting the process on my blog along the way. Once it’s livable I will move into the van full-time. I will attend work and school while living in the van.</p>
<p>Walmart has an open boondocking policy. This means I have a place to park overnight. I will be getting a gym membership so I have somewhere to shower.</p>
<p>Cooking will be done with a portable stove. I need to be making my own food, so no frozen dinners.</p>
<p>The van is gonna need work. I’ll first replace the fuel lines as they are old and worn out. Modern fuel will further add wear and tear which leaves the risk of fires. I’ll also add an extinguisher tube over the engine bay for good measure.</p>
<p>The mattress will need to be replaced probably. I’m thinking memory foam, but it might be too expensive.</p>
<p>Lastly, I’ll need to setup the electrical system. Gonna need some solar panels. Also gonna tear out the side-loading fridge and replace it with more storage. I’ll get a top-loading one and put it between the two front seats. Side-loading fridges use too much electricity because they need to recycle every time you open them.</p>
<p>I think that’s all I’ll need to do to make it livable.</p>
<p>The van will probably cost between three and six grand. Making it livable will be another couple thousand. Over time I’ll be adding to it. I wanna make it ready for overlanding/offroading. I’m expecting to spend twenty to twenty-five grand on the project overall. With the job I’m likely to get by the end of next week I’ll be able to afford it. Keep in mind it’ll all be done over the course of four to six years.</p>
<p>As for college, I plan to take automotive and carpentry, but I might add engineering to it. Austin Community College has some great programs so the options are endless.</p>
<p>Once I have completed college I will begin my journey. I intend to travel everywhere and work while I do so. I’m expecting it’ll cost between $900 and $1,200 a month. This is a very affordable lifestyle, and the jobs I can get on the road will pay for it and more. I’ve had this dream for many years and I’m finally on my way to making it happen.</p>
